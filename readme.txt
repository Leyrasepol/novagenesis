There are two ways to run NovaGenesis: (i) with Docker containers; (ii) without containers locally.

If you want to run with Docker containers, you need to create them first. Use: sudo sh make-all-docker-images.sh

If you want to run locally without Docker containers, go to the Make directory and use: sudo sh compile.sh

Enjoy!
